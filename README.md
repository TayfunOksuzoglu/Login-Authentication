# Login Authentication Project

This project is a simple login authentication system implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes features for both user login and registration. The project interface consists of a login and a sign-up form. Users can switch between the login and sign-up forms through corresponding links. The login form allows users to input their email and password, whereas the sign-up form enables users to register with their email and password, along with a password confirmation field.
